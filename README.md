### Tips
- `rails routes` - to see all app routes
- `password_digest:string` - for saving decoded password in db
- `rails c` - to open interacting in console with db, then `<model_name (User)>` -> User.all (for example) 
- `rails db:migrate:redo` - drop the table and create a db table again
- `@user` - defined the var this way (with @) means this var will be accessible in view; without `@` - just local var accessible inside a class
